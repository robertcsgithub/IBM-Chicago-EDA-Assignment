# Chicago EDA Assignment
This was an exploratoratory data analysis assignment on Chicago utilizing public data in a Jupyter Notebook environment. They threw in some SQL practice in there and I had to connect to the IBM DB2 database. For the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. This was actually pretty cool to me analyzing the data about Chicago. Shout out Chicago.
