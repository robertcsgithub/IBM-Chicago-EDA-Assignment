# Chicago EDA Assignment
This was an exploratoratory data analysis assignment on Chicago utilizing public data in a Jupyter Notebook environment. SQL practice and I had to connect to the IBM DB2 mainframe database. IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. This was pretty insightful to me analyzing the data on the city of Chicago. Shout out Chicago.
